We built these interactive data visualization apps using RShiny to allow you to form your own hypotheses about biological responses to climate change and test them using historical and contemporary data. One thing we love about these examples is that they take advantage of both climatic gradients <em>and</em> historical data to really help us understand and predict the effects of climate change. Each case study includes all the background you need to understand the data and an interactive interface you can use to visualize it in different ways.
