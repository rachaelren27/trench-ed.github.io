<li><b>Acclimation<b>: A physiological or behavioral response to a change in the environment that enables an individual to cope with this change (e.g. a plant growing deeper roots (to access moisture deeper in the soil) in response to a drought).</li>
<li><b>Adaptation</b>: A change in the genetic makeup of a population as a result of natural selection in which a beneficial trait becomes more common (e.g. male birds developing colorful feathers because this increases their success in mating).</li>
<li><b>Allele</b>: A specific version of a gene.</li>
<li><b>Climatic Gradient</b>: A directional change in climate (e.g. temperature, precipitation) along a geographic axis (e.g. a fall in temperature with increasing elevation on a mountain, an increase in precipitation with decreasing latitude). </li>
<li><b>Critical Thermal Minimum/Maximum</b>: The minimum and maximum temperatures at which an organism can function.</li>
<li><b>Diapause</b>: A period during which an organism is dormant and development is paused, usually seen in invertebrates.</li>
<li><b>Dispersal</b>: The movement of an individual or a propagule (seed, spore) across space, leading to gene flow. </li>
<li><b>Distribution Range</b>: The geographic area in which a species or population can be found.</li>
<li><b>Ectotherm</b>: An organism whose body temperature is dependent on external heat sources rather than internal physiology.</li>
<li><b>Elevational Transect</b>: A series of sites located along an elevational gradient, at which scientific observations are made.</li>
<li><b>Fitness</b>: The number of offspring an individual or population produces which go on to successfully breed themselves.</li>
<li><b>Fitness Constraint</b>: Any factor that limits the fitness of an individual or population (e.g. a limited number of mates; limited food resources; environmental stress). </li>
<li><b>Gene</b>: A sequence of nucleotides in a fixed location on a chromosome that encodes (contains instructions to make) a protein that performs a particular function. </li>
<li><b>Gene Flow<b><: The movement of alleles between populations./li>
<li><b>Genotype</b>: The complete genetic makeup of an individual.</li>
<li><b>Instar</b>: A phase in the development of an invertebrate.</li>
<li><b>Local Adaptation</b>: The process by which a population becomes more genetically well-suited to the specific environmental conditions where it is found, as a result of limited gene flow. </li>
<li><b>Metabolism</b>: The chemical processes taking place inside an organism that maintain life.</li>
<li><b>Morphology</b>: The physical form and structure of a living thing. </li>
<li><b>Natural Selection</b>: The process by which alleles encoding for traits that increase fitness become more common and alleles encoding for traits that decrease fitness become less common. </li>
<li><b>Phenology</b>: The timing of important events in the life of an organism.</li>
<li><b>Phenotype</b>: The complete set of observable traits belonging to an individual.</li>
<li><b>Physiology</b>: The physical and chemical functions and activity of living things. </li>
<li><b>Plasticity</b>: The ability of an individual to change its phenotype in response to the environment without changing its genotype.</li>
<li><b>Range Shift</b>: A change in the geographic area in which a species of population can be found.</li>
<li><b>Space-For-Time Substitution</b>: An ecological technique by which sites that are separated in space are used as analogues for sites that are separated in time.</li>
<li><b>Thermal Generalist/Specialist</b>: An organism that is capable of functioning at a wide range of temperatures vs. one that can only function within a narrow temperature window.</li>
<li><b>Thermoregulation</b>: The process by which an organism maintains its preferred body temperature, either through internal physiological processes or behavioral changes.</li>
<li><b>Trait</b>: Any characteristic of an organism (e.g. coat color); a functional trait is one that is important in determining an organism's ecology or evolution.</li>
