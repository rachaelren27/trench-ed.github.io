* **Acclimation**: An individual level (generally non-genetic) physiological or behavioral response to a change in the environment that enables the individual to cope with this change (e.g. a plant growing deeper roots (to access moisture deeper in the soil) in response to a drought). See also: "**Plasticity**".
* **Adaptation**: A change in the genetic makeup of a population as a result of natural selection in which a beneficial trait becomes more common (e.g. male birds developing colorful feathers because this increases their success in mating).
* **Allele**: A specific version of a gene.
* **Amplitude**: The degree of difference from an average (e.g. the extent of variability in temperature from the mean)
* **Biomimetic**: Something that mimics or is inspired by a biological process.
* **Climatic Gradient**: A directional change in climate (e.g. temperature, precipitation) along a geographic axis (e.g. a fall in temperature with increasing elevation on a mountain, an increase in precipitation with decreasing latitude).
* **Critical Thermal Minimum/Maximum**: The minimum and maximum temperatures at which an organism can function.
* **Diapause**: A period during which an organism is dormant and development is paused, usually seen in invertebrates.
* **Dispersal**: The movement of an individual or a propagule (seed, spore) across space, leading to gene flow.
* **Distribution Range**: The geographic area in which a species or population can be found.
* **Ectotherm**: An organism whose body temperature is dependent on external heat sources rather than internal physiology.
* **Elevational Transect**: A series of sites located along an elevational gradient, at which scientific observations are made.
* **Fitness**: The number of offspring an individual or population produces which go on to successfully breed themselves.
* **Fitness Constraint**: Any factor that limits the fitness of an individual or population (e.g. a limited number of mates; limited food resources; environmental stress).
* **Frequency**: The rate at which something occurs or is repeated.
* **Gene**: A sequence of nucleotides in a fixed location on a chromosome that encodes (contains instructions to make) a protein that performs a particular function.
* **Gene Flow**: The movement of alleles between populations.
* **Genotype**: The genetic makeup of an individual.
* **Instar**: A phase in the development of an invertebrate.
* **Local Adaptation**: The process by which a population becomes more genetically well-suited to the specific environmental conditions where it is found, as a result of limited gene flow.
* **Metabolism**: The chemical processes taking place inside an organism that maintain life.
* **Morphology**: The physical form and structure of a living thing.
* **Natural Selection**: The process by which alleles encoding for traits that increase fitness become more common and alleles encoding for traits that decrease fitness become less common.
* **Phenology**: The timing of important events in the life of an organism.
* **Phenotype**: The set of observable traits belonging to an individual.
* **Physiology**: The physical and chemical functions and activity of living things.
* **Plasticity**: The ability of an individual to change its phenotype in response to the environment without changing its genotype. See also: "**Acclimation**".
* **Range Shift**: A change in the geographic area in which a species of population can be found.
* **Sedentary**: Of an animal, meaning that it lives in the same place throughout its life. For example, a mussel attached to a rock. </li>
* **Space-For-Time Substitution**: An ecological technique by which sites that are separated in space are used as analogues for sites that are separated in time.
* **Thermal Generalist/Specialist**: An organism that is capable of functioning at a wide range of temperatures vs. one that can only function within a narrow temperature window.
* **Thermoregulation**: The process by which an organism maintains its preferred body temperature, either through internal physiological processes or behavioral changes.
* **Trait**: Any characteristic of an organism (e.g. coat color); a functional trait is one that is important in determining an organism's ecology or evolution.
