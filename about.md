TrEnCh-Ed is the educational branch of <a href="https://trenchproject.github.io/">The TrEnCh Project</a>, which builds computational and visualization tools to **Tr**anslate **En**vironmental **Ch**ange into organismal responses. We created this website as a tutorial on the science behind those tools, for students of all ages who are interested in learning about how living things on our planet are responding to climate change. 

TrEnCh and TrEnCh-Ed are productions of the <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/lbuckley/">Buckley Lab</a> at the University of Washington, Seattle. Most of the text on this site was written by Meera Lee Sethi, a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jhrl/Index.html">Hille Ris Lambers lab</a> studying climate change and plant-insect interactions.
