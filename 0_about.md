	<h3 class="major">What is TrEnCh-Ed?</h3>
	
<p>TrEnCh-Ed is the educational branch of <a href="https://trenchproject.github.io/" target="_blank">The TrEnCh Project</a>, which builds computational and visualization tools to <b>Tr</b>anslate <b>En</b>vironmental <b>Ch</b>ange into organismal responses. We created this website as a tutorial on the science behind those tools for people who are interested in learning about how living things on our planet are responding to climate change. </p>
	
	
	<h3 class="major">How to use the site</h3>

<p>The material on this website is written to be easily accessible to advanced high schoolers, beginning undergraduates, and beyond. If you are an educator, we invite you to integrate  TrEnCh-Ed into your classroom or homework activities in any way that works for you, and we will be adding links between our content and national science education standards soon. The best way to approach the site is to move from left to right along the tabs on the home page: 

	<ul>
		<li>Start with our basic introduction to <a href="https://trench-ed.github.io/#climate-change" target="_blank">climate change</a>.</li>
		<li>Understand how climate affects the <a href="https://trench-ed.github.io/#physiology" target="_blank">physiology</a> of living things.</li>
		<li>Find out why ecologists use elevational and latitudinal <a href="https://trench-ed.github.io/#gradients" target="_blank">gradients</a> and sources of <a href="https://trench-ed.github.io/#Historical-Data" target="_blank">historical data</a> to help predict the biological impacts of climate change.</li>
				<li>Apply your new knowledge by exploring the <a href="https://trench-ed.github.io/#Data-Visualizations" target="_blank">data visualization apps</a> we built to dive deep into two case studies about climate change and organismal responses. </li>
<li> Use the <a href="https://trench-ed.github.io/#glossary" target="_blank">glossary</a> as needed to understand technical terms.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

<h3 class="major">Who we are</h3>

<p>TrEnCh and TrEnCh-Ed are productions of the <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/lbuckley/">Buckley Lab</a> at the University of Washington, Seattle, and are funded by NSF DBI#1349865 (â€œCAREER: Computational and visualization tools for translating climate change into ecological impacts"). Most of the text on this site was written by Meera Lee Sethi, a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jhrl/Index.html">Hille Ris Lambers lab</a> studying climate change and plant-insect interactions. </p>
