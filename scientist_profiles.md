<h3>The stories of the people behind the science</h3>       
 
<p>Scientists come from all different backgrounds, experiences, cultures, and communities. In fact, teams thrive with diverse perspectives [<a hred="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">cit</a>]. Below are profiles of the team of scientists behind TrEnCh-Ed.</p>

 <li><i>Introduction:</i> I’m a biology professor at the University of Washington. I started out studying engineering but found that I was more interested in how animals respond to their environment than in how metals bend under force (which was what my engineering courses entailed at the time. But engineering, for example developing alternative energy technologies, is an awesome way to help address climate change). My parents convinced me that continuing to study math would help me as a biologist and they were right! My research combines mathematical models with laboratory and field observations to improve predictions of how animals respond ecologically and evolve in response to climate change. I love exploring Colorado mountains, repeating historic studies to see how insects have responded to climate change.</li>      
<li><i>Favorite part of science:</i> My favorite is making discoveries about how organisms are responding to climate change. Every time I make a new plot of data it’s a potentially interesting new discovery. The visualizations on this website aim to enable you to participate in the discovery process.</li> 
<li><i>Overcoming challenges:</i> It’s sometimes a challenge to present my ideas in a way that they are heard. One early example was a grade school geography bee. On the practice day, the boys I was matched up against in the first chairs would raise their hands to answer the questions before they were even asked. I thought it was stupid to raise hands so early and that it shouldn’t be allowed so I ended up not answering any questions. Afterward, my teacher took me aside and told me that my team was counting on me to answer the questions even if I didn’t like how the boys were playing the game. She also said that I was just as likely to be able to answer correctly. During the bee, I instantly raised my hand and answered the questions and I’ve been gradually learning to raise my hand and speak up since.</li>   
<li><i>Mentor/Program of importance in your life:</i> I had the opportunity to spend the summer at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in the National Science Foundation’s Research Experience for Undergraduates program. It was amazing to live in a rickety shack in an abandoned mining town at the base of a beautiful mountain, surrounded by other scientists excited to study how organisms interact with their environment. In addition to my independent project, many researchers welcomed me to spend some time assisting their varied projects. I was hooked once I saw how much they all enjoyed their research.</li> 
<li><i>Favorite hobby/activity:</i> My two young kids are working on their insect catching skills to help in the field. Their often challenging questions about how things work remind me of the joy of science.</li></ul></p>

 <li><i>Introduction:</i> Hi, I'm Meera. I'm a 41-year-old Indian-Chinese woman from Singapore who's lived in different parts of the U.S. for over 20 years. Currently, I'm finishing up my Ph.D at the University of Washington. I'm an ecologist, and am fascinated by the relationships living things have with each other and how they shape communities of plants and animals. I live with my partner (a computer vision researcher), our wonderful and ridiculous cat, three Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches, and three Giant American Millipedes (which are not that gigantic).</li>    
<li><i>Favorite part of science:</i> My favorite part of science is that it's much more important to ask good questions than it is to know lots of answers.</li>     
<li><i>Mentor/Program of importance in your life:</i> I didn't know that I wanted to be a scientist until I was in my mid-30s. Since my undergraduate degree was in the humanities, I didn't have the basic academic background that I needed to apply to graduate programs in the sciences. I would not be where I am today if it weren't for the fact that I was able to take affordable community college classes close to my home.</li> 
<li><i>Favorite hobby/activity:</i> So many! Currently, planting and caring for the native plants in my yard is an everyday way to observe some of the myriad interactions between species that inspire my science—in a few minutes I might see bumble bees and wasps pollinating flowers, spiders waiting for prey, or a slug feeding on vegetation.</li></ul></p>
