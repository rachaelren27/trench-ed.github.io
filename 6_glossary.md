<li>Acclimation: A physiological or behavioral response to a change in the environment that enables an individual to cope with this change (e.g. a plant growing deeper roots (to access moisture deeper in the soil) in response to a drought).</li>
<li>Adaptation: A change in the genetic makeup of a population as a result of natural selection in which a beneficial trait becomes more common (e.g. male birds developing colorful feathers because this increases their success in mating).</li>
<li>Allele: A specific version of a gene.</li>
<li>Climatic Gradient: A directional change in climate (e.g. temperature, precipitation) along a geographic axis (e.g. a fall in temperature with increasing elevation on a mountain, an increase in precipitation with decreasing latitude). </li>
<li>Critical Thermal Minimum/Maximum: The minimum and maximum temperatures at which an organism can function.</li>
<li>Diapause: A period during which an organism is dormant and development is paused, usually seen in invertebrates.</li>
<li>Dispersal: The movement of an individual or a propagule (seed, spore) across space, leading to gene flow. </li>
<li>Distribution Range: The geographic area in which a species or population can be found.</li>
<li>Ectotherm: An organism whose body temperature is dependent on external heat sources rather than internal physiology.</li>
<li>Elevational Transect: A series of sites located along an elevational gradient, at which scientific observations are made.</li>
<li>Fitness: The number of offspring an individual or population produces which go on to successfully breed themselves.</li>
<li>Fitness Constraint: Any factor that limits the fitness of an individual or population (e.g. a limited number of mates; limited food resources; environmental stress). </li>
<li>Gene: A sequence of nucleotides in a fixed location on a chromosome that encodes (contains instructions to make) a protein that performs a particular function. </li>
<li>Gene Flow<: The movement of alleles between populations./li>
<li>Genotype: The complete genetic makeup of an individual.</li>
<li>Instar: A phase in the development of an invertebrate.</li>
<li>Local Adaptation: The process by which a population becomes more genetically well-suited to the specific environmental conditions where it is found, as a result of limited gene flow. </li>
<li>Metabolism: The chemical processes taking place inside an organism that maintain life.</li>
<li>Morphology: The physical form and structure of a living thing. </li>
<li>Natural Selection: The process by which alleles encoding for traits that increase fitness become more common and alleles encoding for traits that decrease fitness become less common. </li>
<li>Phenology: The timing of important events in the life of an organism.</li>
<li>Phenotype: The complete set of observable traits belonging to an individual.</li>
<li>Physiology: The physical and chemical functions and activity of living things. </li>
<li>Plasticity: The ability of an individual to change its phenotype in response to the environment without changing its genotype.</li>
<li>Range Shift: A change in the geographic area in which a species of population can be found.</li>
<li>Space-For-Time Substitution: An ecological technique by which sites that are separated in space are used as analogues for sites that are separated in time.</li>
<li>Thermal Generalist/Specialist: An organism that is capable of functioning at a wide range of temperatures vs. one that can only function within a narrow temperature window.</li>
<li>Thermoregulation: The process by which an organism maintains its preferred body temperature, either through internal physiological processes or behavioral changes.</li>
<li>Trait: Any characteristic of an organism (e.g. coat color); a functional trait is one that is important in determining an organism's ecology or evolution.</li>
